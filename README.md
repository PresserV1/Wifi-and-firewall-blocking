# Wifi-and-firewall-blocking
Basically just made it to use when pirating games saves me time instead of manually having to turn off Wi-Fi and setting inbounding and out bounding rules i can use this since its more efficient.




How to use

1. Save the code below into a file, e.g. (Download This)

2. Run it on a Windows machine: python net_control_ui.py (Python 3.8+ recommended). If not started as admin it will ask to re-launch as admin.

3. In the UI:
 - Select the Wi-Fi adapter (the program attempts to auto-detect adapters whose name or description contains wi, wireless, or wifi).
 - Click Disable Wi-Fi / Enable Wi-Fi to toggle the adapter.
 - Click Block Inbound+Outbound to set firewall profiles to block inbound and outbound (saves previous settings).
 - Click Restore Firewall to return saved settings.
